# CaesarCipher

Simple Encryption GUI created with C#.

Started out as a Caesar Cipher, but decided to add Vigenère as well when I finished the Caesar faster than I anticipated. This is why the file for the code is named "CaesarCipher", as well as the form.

Important note: This shouldn't be taken as a viable tool of encrypting important things such as passwords and sensitive messages. Caesar and Vigenère ciphers are not only easy to decrypt, but there are far better and far more complex encryption methods you can use. I made this for fun and to gain further knowledge on arrays and logic in C#.
